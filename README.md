# Sorting Algorithms
Most common sorting algorithms based on the Symfony framework.
The best way to understand those alogrithms is to debug their tests. Just look at what happens to the $sortable array.

* Bubble Sort O(n<sup>n</sup>)
* Selection Sort O(n<sup>2</sup>)
* Insertion Sort O(n<sup>2</sup>)
